# Typescript

type = we can use structure of objet again & again. No need to define object structure every time.

union Types = we can declare function parameter one of many types
A function or varivbale can be many types.

intersection types = in object one varible can't be number & string. so to allow both in same variable we use & it allow

when you create an intersection type using the & operator, you're combining multiple types into one. This means that an object of the resulting type must satisfy all the properties and methods defined in each type.

LITERALS -> (EXACT, SPECIFIED);
That means we decalre var and we pass some value or string in it if we call that varble and assigne it diff value out of this 3 then it give error beacuse we need to giev defined value
